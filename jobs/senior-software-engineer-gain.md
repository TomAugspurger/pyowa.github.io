## Senior Software Engineer (API) – Des Moines
### Gain Compliance


[Gain Compliance Careers](https://gaincompliance.com/careers/)

We are looking for software engineers to build out our cloud-based insurance platform. As an early employee in an early-stage startup you will have an immense impact on the success of the company and will be rewarded with an options package to match that impact.

More than anything, we are looking for people who are passionate about building great products that customers love – people willing to go out of their way to make things easy to use and put the burden on the software not on the customer. For technical skills, a combination of:

* NoSQL databases (Google Datastore, Mongo, AWS DynamoDB, etc.)
* python (or other functional programming experience)
* running API’s in AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or other cloud infrastructure providers
* XP practices including automated testing and continuous deployment

Located in Des Moines.
